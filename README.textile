h2. The missing weblog engine

Typo is a modern, lightweight, comprehensive, full featured Weblog engine using Ruby on Rails. It's been around since 2004 and probably the oldest open source project based on Ruby on Rails.

Typo provides you with everything you need to easily publish content on the Web.

**Multi user:** role based management for multiple authors Web sites.

**Powerful plugin engine:** available both in page, as text filters and as widgets.

**Comprehensive theme support:** every aspect of the blog can be redesigned according to your needs without changing a single line of the core engine.

**Cool API:** Typo supports the various blogging engine APIs so you can publish from desktop clients.

**On demand editor:** Typo supports various editors (visual, plain HTML, Markdown, Textile)

h2. Download Typo

For a production blog, you should download "download Typo 6.1.3":http://typosphere.org/stable.tgz

If you feel adventurous or want to hack on Typo, "clone Typo repository":git://github.com/fdv/typo.git

h2. Install Typo locally

h3. Prerequisites

To install Typo you need the following:

* Ruby 1.9.2 or 1.9.3. 
* Ruby On Rails 3.0.10
* A database engine, MySQL, PgSQL or SQLite3

h3. Install Typo

# Unzip Typo archive
# Rename database.yml.yourEngine as database.yml
# Edit database.yml to add your database name, login and password. 

<pre>
$ bundle install
$ rake db:create
$ ./script/rails server
</pre>

You don't need to run @rake db:migrate@ and @rake db:seed@ as Typo will take care of everything the first time you access 127.0.0.1:3000.

h2. Install Typo on Heroku

In order to install Typo on Heroku, you'll need to do some minor tweaks...

h3. Database

Just add the Heroku Postgres plugin to your app. When deploying, Heroku will write the database configuration so you don't have to do anything.

h3. Storage

You need to setup Amazon s3 storage to be able to upload files on your blog. Edit @config/storage.yml@

<pre>
provider: AWS
engine: AWS
aws_access_key_id: YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key: YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
</pre>

h3. Gemfile

Replace the default @Gemfile@ by @Gemfile.heroku@ : @cp Gemfile Gemfile.heroku@.
Heroku may also needs the ruby version to be declared, you may add @ruby "1.9.3"@ after the source to use the latest Ruby version.

Heroku will also boot your app on Webrick, the default Ruby web server, which is rather slow. Just add thin to get some free speed.

Now, run 

<pre>
bundle install
</pre>

h3. Gemfile.lock

Heroku needs Gemfile.lock to be in the Git repository. Remove Gemfile.lock from .gitignore and add it `git add .gitignore Gemfile.lock`
