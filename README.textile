h2. Download Typo

For a production blog, you should download "download Typo 6.1.3":http://typosphere.org/stable.tgz

If you feel adventurous or want to hack on Typo, "clone Typo repository":git://github.com/fdv/typo.git

h2. Install Typo locally

<a name="prerequisites"></a>

h3. Prerequisites

To install Typo you need the following:

* Ruby 1.9.2 or 1.9.3. 
* Ruby On Rails 3.0.10
* A database engine, MySQL, PgSQL or SQLite3

<a href="installtypo"></a>

h3. Install Typo

# Unzip Typo archive
# Rename database.yml.yourEngine as database.yml
# Edit database.yml to add your database name, login and password. 

<pre>
$ bundle install
$ rake db:create
$ ./script/rails server
</pre>

You don't need to run @rake db:migrate@ and @rake db:seed@ as Typo will take care of everything the first time you access 127.0.0.1:3000.

<a href="installtypoonheroku"></a>

h2. Install Typo on Heroku

In order to install Typo on Heroku, you'll need to do some minor tweaks...

<a name="database"></a>

h3. Database

Just add the Heroku Postgres plugin to your app. When deploying, Heroku will write the database configuration so you don't have to do anything.

<a name="storage"></a>

h3. Storage

You need to setup Amazon s3 storage to be able to upload files on your blog. Edit @config/storage.yml@

<pre>
provider: AWS
engine: AWS
aws_access_key_id: YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key: YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
</pre>

<a name="gemfile"></a>

h3. Gemfile

Replace the default @Gemfile@ by @Gemfile.heroku@ : @cp Gemfile Gemfile.heroku@.
Heroku may also needs the ruby version to be declared, you may add @ruby "1.9.3"@ after the source to use the latest Ruby version.

Heroku will also boot your app on Webrick, the default Ruby web server, which is rather slow. Just add thin to get some free speed.

Now, run 

<pre>
bundle install
</pre>

<a name="gemfilelock"></a>

h3. Gemfile.lock

Heroku needs Gemfile.lock to be in the Git repository. Remove Gemfile.lock from .gitignore and add it `git add .gitignore Gemfile.lock`

<a name="createasimpletheme"></a>

h2. Create a simple theme

Typo offers a very slick and evolved theme engine. It allows theme developers to override every view of the application, or just add their own layout, stylesheet, and let Typo do the job.

A Typo template is made _a minima_ with 3 main files:

* The layout.
* A CSS stylesheet.
* An about file using markdown.
* You can eventually add a screenshot, and some fancy pictures in your theme, but they are not mandatory.

Browsing a default Typo theme looks like:

<pre>
themes 
      \_ my theme
                 \_ about.markdown
                 \_ images
                 \_ layouts
                           \_ default.html.erb
                 \_ preview.png
                 \_ stylesheets
                               \_ style.css
</pre>

Your main file is in @layouts/default.html.erb@, which is your theme main template. This is a simple RHTML file in which you'll call Typo main methods.

<a name="createasimplethemeheader"></a>

h3. Header

This is a standard HTML file header, along with some ruby calls. Nothing complicated at all here.

<pre>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="fr">
<head profile="http://gmpg.org/xfn/11">
  <title><%= h(page_title) %></title>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Language" content="fr" />

  <%= stylesheet_link_tag "/stylesheets/theme/style", :media => ‘all’ %>
  <%= page_header %>
</head>
</pre>

There are some things you must pay attention to:

* h(page_title) is the title of the current document. This is generated by Typo, and translation in supported languages is done when avaliable.
* stylesheet_link_tag is where you call your CSS stylesheet. It will always be in @/stylesheets/theme/@. Some call it @style.css@, some @application.css@, but do whatever you want.
* page_header withh display a page header generated by Typo. It will provide:
** ICBM tag, for geo localization.
** Your meta description.
** Your meta keywods.
** Your RSD.
** URLs for both your RSS and Atom feeds, for automatic discovery.
** Stylesheets used by Typo embedded plugins, so that you don't have to care.
** Google analytics tags, if provided.

<a name="createasimplethemebody"></a>

h3. Body

Every @div@ included here are not mandatory. You just need to care about the ruby calls.

<pre>
<body>
<div id="header">
  <h1><a href="<%= this_blog.base_url %>"><%= this_blog.blog_name %></a></h1>
  <h2><%= this_blog.blog_subtitle %></h2>
</div>

<div id="page">
  <div id="content">
    <%= yield %>
  </div>

  <div id="sidebar">
    <%= render_sidebars %>
  </div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
</pre>

The importants things are:

* @this_blog.base_url@ is your blog URL defined in your settings.
* @this_blog.name@ is your blog title, defined in your settings.
* @this_blog.blog_subtitle@ is your blog tagline, defined in your settings.
* @yield@ is the most important part of your layout. It renders the page main content according to what you're browsing (articles, tags, categories...)
* @render_sidebars@ displays your sdebar made of Typo plugins.

Here you are. You can now build a standard Typo theme and profit from the great things Typo can provide.

h2. Advanced theme cration

Typo offers custom post type. Let's say you blog about tech and wine, and want to display wine posts differently. You upload an attached picture to every wine related post and want it to be displayed in every article. You also have a custom CSS for wine blocks, and don't want people to comment your wine reviews (this to make the sample template more readable). You also want to apply this to the category page.

<a name="advancedthemecreationpavethepath"></a>

h3. Pave the path

First, login to your blog admin and go to Article -&gt; Post Types. Create a new post type called Wine. 

Now, create a new category in Articles -&gt; Categories. We'll call it Wine too. 

<a name="advancedthemecreationcreatetemplate"></a>

h3. Create the templates

Create 2 custom templates: one to display wine related articles, and one to display the Wine category.

First, create a templates called @wine.html.erb@ in your @theme/views/articles/@ directory. If the @views/articles@ directory doesn't exist, create it. The template will probably look like something like this:

<pre>
<div class="wine" %>>
  <h2><%= link_to_permalink @article, @article.title %></h2>
  <p class="auth"><%= _("Posted by")%> <%= author_link(@article) %>
  <%= display_date_and_time @article.published_at %></p>
  <%= @article.html(:body) %>
  <!-- This display the attached images -->
  <% @article.resources.each do |upload| %>
    <img src='<%= "#{this_blog.base_url}/files/#{upload.filename}" %>' class="centered" />
  <% end %>
  <div class="extended">
    <%= @article.html(:extended) %>
  </div>

</div>
<p class="meta">
  <%= article_links @article %>
</p>
</pre>

Do the same with the wine category. In your theme @/views/categories@, create a @wine.html.erb@ template. This is adapted from the @category/show.html.erb@ of one of the stock themes.

<pre>
<h1><%= link_to "Wine", "#{this_blog.base_url}/category/#{params[:id]}" %></h1>

<div class='category-excerpt <%= "border" if @article_counter >= 0 %>' id="article-<%= article.id %>">
  
<% @articles.each do |article| %>
  <h2><%= link_to_permalink(article, article.title) %></h2>
  <p class="auth"><%= _("Posted by")%> <%= author_link(earticle) %>
  <%= display_date_and_time article.published_at %></p>
  <%= article.html(:body) %>
  <!-- This display the attached images -->
  <% article.resources.each do |upload| %>
    <img src='<%= "#{this_blog.base_url}/files/#{upload.filename}" %>' class="centered" />
  <% end %>
  <div class="extended">
    <%= article.html(:extended) %>
  </div>
<% end %>
</div>

<div id='paginate'>
  <%= paginate @articles, { :previous_label => _('Previous'), :next_label => _('Next')  } %>
</div>
</pre>

Here you are, you can now write about wine. Just don't forget to chose the wine post type within the editor.
